## Instructions for Commenting on Draft Open Data Policy 
The City of San Rafael is committed to freely sharing as much information
as possible. We recognize that information is a valuable resource and a
strategic asset to the public.  Making information accessible,
discoverable, and usable by the public can help fuel entrepreneurship,
innovation, scientific discovery, and a more efficient government.

Our goal is for the City to adopt an open data policy within the year.

# Introductions for Commenting on Draft Open Data Policy 
The City of San Jose is committed to freely sharing as much information
as possible. We recognize that information is a valuable resource and a
strategic asset to the public.  Making information accessible,
discoverable, and usable by the public can help fuel entrepreneurship,
innovation, scientific discovery, and a more efficient government.

In 2016 the City will launch an open data portal and adopt an open data
policy.  Over the next few months, the City will gather community input
through a [digital
survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SJOpenDataSurvey) and a series of
public events.

We appreciate your interest in the City of San Jose’s Draft Open Data
Policy. ***This is a draft and is subject to further revision***. As
part of our commitment to transparency and community engagement, we
welcome your interest and feedback on how we can make this policy more
effective. Please send comments or a draft of this document with your
suggested revisions to <opendata@sanjoseca.gov> no later than Friday,
December 18, 2015.
